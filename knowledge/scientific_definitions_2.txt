Sadness
Core definition:
Sadness is a negative emotional state associated with loss, unmet needs, disappointment, or perceived helplessness.
Biological mechanisms:
Reduced physiological arousal (low energy, slower movement).
Increased activity in brain areas related to social bonding and memory (subgenual anterior cingulate cortex).
Neurochemical changes: decreased dopamine, reduced serotonin regulation.
Promotes tear production, which may release stress-related chemicals.
Cognitive processes:
Focus on past events, rumination, reflection.
Increased attention to sources of loss or failure.
More realistic (sometimes overly pessimistic) evaluations.
Behavioral patterns:
Withdrawal from social or stimulating environments.
Slower speech, reduced motivation, decreased pleasure.
Typical triggers:
Loss (relationship, object, ability, routine).
Social rejection or exclusion.
Failure to achieve goals.
Empathic sadness — seeing someone else suffer.
Adaptive functions:
Signals need for help or comfort from others.
Encourages rest, healing, and emotional processing.
Helps re-evaluate goals or strategies after failure.
Maladaptive patterns:
Chronic rumination → depression.
Social isolation that increases distress rather than reducing it.
Joy
Core definition:
Joy is a positive, high-energy emotional state linked to reward, connection, and subjective well-being.
Biological mechanisms:
Increases dopamine, endorphins, and sometimes oxytocin.
Activates reward circuits in the ventral striatum & prefrontal cortex.
Enhances immune function and reduces cortisol.
Cognitive processes:
Broader attentional focus (“broaden-and-build” theory).
More creative, flexible thinking.
Optimistic interpretation of events.
Behavioral patterns:
Smiling, laughter, energetic movement.
Increased social engagement and generosity.
Motivation to explore, play, or share good news.
Typical triggers:
Achieving goals / progress toward goals.
Social bonding, affection, humour.
Novel positive experiences.
Adaptive functions:
Reinforces behaviors that support survival or social cohesion.
Encourages cooperation and long-term bonding.
Improves memory formation and learning.
Maladaptive patterns:
Excessive sensation-seeking.
Unrealistic optimism affecting decision-making.
Love
Core definition:
Love is a multi-dimensional emotional system integrating attachment, bonding, reward, and caregiving processes.
Biological mechanisms:
Oxytocin and vasopressin promote bonding and trust.
Dopamine reinforces interpersonal connection.
Reduced amygdala activity increases feelings of safety.
Long-term memory networks encode relationship-specific cues.
Cognitive processes:
Selective attention toward loved ones.
Increased empathy, perspective-taking.
Long-term planning and commitment patterns.
Behavioral patterns:
Caregiving behaviors, affection, protective actions.
Sacrifice, long-term investment in relationships.
Synchronization in communication and body language.
Typical triggers:
Physical closeness, shared experiences.
Mutual trust and vulnerability.
Infant-caregiver interactions, romantic attraction, friendships.
Adaptive functions:
Supports stable pair bonding.
Increases offspring survival.
Creates cooperative groups for mutual protection and resources.
Maladaptive patterns:
Codependency or loss of personal boundaries.
Attachment anxiety or obsessive preoccupation.
Anger
Core definition:
Anger is a high-arousal emotional response to perceived threat, injustice, boundary violation, or obstruction.
Biological mechanisms:
Sympathetic nervous system activation → adrenaline, noradrenaline.
Increased heart rate, blood pressure, muscle readiness.
Amygdala activation + reduced prefrontal inhibition during intense anger.
Cognitive processes:
Strong focus on source of threat or frustration.
Bias toward quick judgments and action (“fight” mode).
Reduced capacity for nuanced evaluation when highly aroused.
Behavioral patterns:
Assertive or aggressive responses.
Increased vocal intensity, sharp movements.
Boundary setting or confrontation.
Typical triggers:
Perceived unfairness, disrespect, or betrayal.
Blocked goals or repeated frustration.
Threats to self, loved ones, or moral values.
Adaptive functions:
Protects physical and psychological boundaries.
Mobilizes energy for problem-solving or defense.
Signals to others that behavior must change.
Maladaptive patterns:
Chronic anger → cardiovascular problems.
Aggression harming relationships or safety.
Suppressed anger leading to passive-aggressive behavior.
Fear
Core definition:
Fear is an intense emotional response to threat or danger, real or anticipated.
Biological mechanisms:
Amygdala activates fight–flight–freeze system.
Release of cortisol and adrenaline.
Rapid sensory processing, increased heart rate & breathing.
Heightened startle reflex.
Cognitive processes:
Attention narrows to danger cues.
Overestimation of risk or negative outcomes.
Faster decision-making prioritizing survival.
Behavioral patterns:
Avoidance, escape, freezing.
Increased vigilance, scanning for danger.
Seeking safety or reassurance.
Typical triggers:
Physical threat, pain, danger.
Uncertainty, unpredictability.
Social fears (evaluation, rejection).
Adaptive functions:
Prevents harm by preparing the body for rapid response.
Enhances learning from dangerous situations.
Protects social status through cautious behavior.
Maladaptive patterns:
Generalized anxiety, phobias.
Avoidance that reinforces fear.
Chronic cortisol exposure affecting health.
Surprise
Core definition:
Surprise is a short-lived emotional reaction to unexpected or novel stimuli.
Biological mechanisms:
Rapid orientation response (increased heart rate, widened eyes).
Activation of the brain’s salience network.
Brief spike in arousal followed by evaluation.
Cognitive processes:
Sudden shift of attention to new information.
Quick updating of mental models (“prediction error”).
Increased curiosity or caution depending on context.
Behavioral patterns:
Startle response (inhalation, raised eyebrows).
Stopping ongoing behavior to reorient.
Exploration or defensive reaction depending on outcome.
Typical triggers:
Unexpected events (positive or negative).
Sudden noises, movements, or information.
Violations of expectations.
Adaptive functions:
Helps detect and evaluate new threats or opportunities.
Improves learning by updating expectations.
Prepares transition to other emotions (fear, joy, curiosity).
Maladaptive patterns:
Hyper-reactivity to minor unexpected changes.
Startle response overuse in trauma-related disorders.
